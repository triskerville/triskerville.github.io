# My Website
This website was built to showcase examples of my work and provide a means of contacting me for employment purposes.

The entire website was built from scratch, and I learned HTML and CSS to create it. There is no JavaScript in use at this time, as the website was designed to be as minimal as possible.

Here's an easier link to jump to the homepage: <https://triskerville.github.io>
